                    The first day, we will go to the Dhammikarama Burmese Temple. Located in Lorong Burma in George
                    Town, this Buddhist temple was built in 1803 and features a serene white marble face and hands
                    Buddha statue, a wishing pool, and some Burmese-style temple buildings, including the newly
                    completed Golden Pagoda Clock Tower, which opened on January 5, 2011. <br>

                    The next day, we will go to Batu Feringgi. This is the most popular beach area in Penang, and many
                    resort hotels are located here. In addition to the normal beach activities, there are various dining
                    and entertainment venues, as well as a night market where you can bargain for clothing, accessories,

                    Teluk Bahang near the park entrance. <br>
                    <strong>DAY 4</strong> <br>
                    The final day will be at the Logan Memorial. The Logan Memorial was erected in 1873 to commemorate
                    Scottish lawyer, newspaper editor, author, and ethnologist James Richardson Logan, known for his
                    defence of the rights of "little people" to be freed from official restrictions in colonial Penang.
