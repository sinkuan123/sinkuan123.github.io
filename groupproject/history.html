        <h1>History of Malaysia</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
        <p class="content1 container">Malaysia's history is started from the Sultanate of Malacca which was around 1400
            AD.
            At the time of its glory, the Sultanate Territories covered most of the East Coast of Peninsular Malaysia
            and
            Sumatra. Malacca emerged as a glorious Government because of its strategic location which was the meeting
            point
            between East Asia and the Middle East. This situation allowed Malacca to emerge as a major trading center
            for
            spice trade, especially in Southeast Asia.
        </p>
        <div class="text-center">
            <img src="img/malacca.jpg" class="img-fluid " alt="...">
        </div>
        <p class="content1 container">In 1511, Malacca fell into the hands of the Portuguese and that was the beginning
            of
            the colonial era in Malaya. After that, Malaya fell into the hands of the Dutch in 1641 and British in 1824
            through the Angloâ€“Dutch Treaty. British colonization was the longest compared to others. The British had
            integrated all the Malayan administration which was previously managed by the Malay Rulers with the help of
            state dignitaries. The British intervention had aroused dissatisfaction among the local population. Some
            individuals rise up against the colonial yet it was easily defeated by the British as their efforts were
            more
            towards individuality.<br><br>
            During the 1920s and 1930s, when the people of this country were so eager to end the
            invasion, they were jolted by the Japanese landing at the end of 1941 which brought Malaya to another
            colonial
            era. Japan had occupied Malaya until 1945 before surrendering as a result of the bombings of Hiroshima and
            Nagasaki.

        <p class="content1 container">Japanese resignation has given space to the Communist Party of Malaya (PKM) to
            control
            Malaya. Thus, in June 1948, Sir Edward Gent has declared emergency over Malaya. PKM did not succeed Malaya
            and
            the British returned powerful. British Military Administration or BMA is between the end World War II and
            establishment of the Malayan Union. On 1st April 1946, The British established the Malayan Union. However,
            this
            idea got a fight from the Malays for abolition the royal institutions and the Malays privileges.

        <p class="content1 container">The emergence of Tunku Abdul Rahman had given a silver lining to the struggle of
            the
            Malayan nationalists when his action of forming the Alliance Party had started to open the eyes of British
            to
            allow the Malayans to govern their own country. The unity between the three major ethnic groups namely
            Malays,
            Chinese and Indians led to the London Agreement that was signed on 8 February 1956 and had given signs that
            Malaya will achieve independence on 31 August 1957. Upon returning Tunku Abdul Rahman Al-haj from London,
            Tunku
            has made a declaration independence of Malaya in Padang Bandar Hilir, Melaka on 20 February 1956. On 27 May
            1961, Tunku Abdul Rahman Putra Alhaj has suggested the merger of five colonies namely the Malaya, Singapore,
            Sabah, Sarawak and Brunei to form a new country.<br><br>

            On 9 July 1963, representatives of the British government, Malaya, Sabah, Sarawak and Singapore except
            Brunei
            caused the matter can not be avoided. The desire for forming a state called MALAYSIA is achieved on 16
            September
            1963.
